I feel like I can definitively say that 2018 was the most exciting year of my life. I got married to my best friend and now wife, and not only that, but I finally took a risk to pursue my dreams that previously were just a distant thought. In July I officially left my former career in Financial Services where I had spent the last 8 years, and started on my journey of learning to code and becoming a web developer. Since officially starting in August, I've learned a staggering amount of information in the close to 720 hours I've spent just studying and have loved every moment of it. Unfortunately I missed my minimum goal of 750 hours,  losing some time to issues with our new puppy, family situations, holiday travel, etc. but I'm still proud of the time I've been able to commit in those short few months and it isn't slowing down one bit. As long as I can continue to hit AT LEAST 150 hours of pure work/study a month (200 ideally), then I feel like I'm in a good spot.

As we get into 2019 I really want to increase that number and push my productivity further. That being said, for this year I've set a few goal for myself. First and foremost I want to finish out the rest of the Flatiron curriculum, graduate (getting closer, I think I just passed the 75% mark!), and find a new job. Ideally I can hit the ground running and minimize the down time. Networking was never my strong suit, but I'd like to force myself to attend more local meetups. In order to accomplish that, I'm pushing myself harder to learn more and make the most of my time. 

Secondly, I'm excited to start #100DaysOfCode as of today to give myself some additional accountability.  My sub-goal with the challenge is to write some form of blog post everyday as well. I hope this will help document my progress and also get me more comfortable with blogging and eventually technical writing as I get further along. As far as personal projects go, I'd like to have at least one larger project per quarter that I pursue in my free time that challenges me and feels like a good demonstration of what I've learned. 

Last but not least, I'd also like to start learning some additional languages and really test what Flatiron has been teaching at its core-- how to learn. Ruby/Rails will always be #1 in my heart, but I think it would be a fun challenge to redo some old projects in a new language, and I'd like to start off with C# later this year. On top of that, TDD is going to play a larger role in my work. I've done some basic TDD but I'd like to get much more knowledgeable in my use of different test suites and writing more efficient code. 

2019 is going to be a very exciting year for me, and if anyone is reading this, I hope you're also feeling excited for the new year and have some equally ambitious goals for yourself! If you're interested in following along, check back in to this blog or twitter, or even check out my Github page:
